    <h4>Paperclip Design Ltd.</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-8 background">
        <h6>Specializes in seating concepts for the aviation industry</h6>
        <p>I designed and built a prototype of an armrest mechanism for an innovative seating concept. It involved testing multiple combinations of gas springs and slide rails to obtain the best user experience. Prototyping time was reduced by 75% by using CAD models to integrate multiple iterations into the same prototype.</p>
        <p> Worked on sound proofing a conference room by minimizing vibrations and sealing air gaps with silicon. Part of the project involved designing and installing an MDF-foam sandwich under the floorboards and felt panels on the walls.</p>
