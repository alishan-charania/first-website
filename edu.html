    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I was born and brought up in Karachi, Pakistan. After completing my secondary schooling, I got admission to Karachi Grammar School, one of the most prestigious high schools in my city. From here, I completed my GCE A'Levels and graduated with a distinction across all my core subjects - Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, and Economics.

        <p>Based on my outstanding A'Levels results, I was awarded a full scholarship to The University of Hong Kong (HKU). I majored in Mechanical Engineering with coursework in a variety of disciplines, including:
          <ul>
            <li>Energy Conversion Systems</li>
            <li>Building Service Engineering</li>
            <li>Materials for Engineering Applications</li>
            <li>Aeronautical Engineering</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>During my four years at HKU, I also served as a Student Ambassador. This was a unique experience through which I got a chance to represent HKU at home and abroad. By speaking at university fairs, freshmen orientations, and conducting vistor tours, I was able to hone my interpersonal skills.

    <h6 style="color:black;">University of Waterloo</h6>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-8 background">
        <p>In my penultimate year at HKU, I got selected for an exchange program to University of Waterloo. The program was one semester long, and I got the chance to study courses that were unique to UWaterloo. Most of my courses at Waterloo were technical electives which meant that class sizes were relatively small - encouraging more of a one to one interaction with the professor.
        </p>
        <p>I felt that a major difference between the curriculum of both schools â€“ especially Mechanical Engineering - is the increased emphasis given in Waterloo on semester-long learning. All my classes had bi-weekly assignments which would ultimately prepare us for our final exams. Professors would make minimal use of the multimedia, thus encouraging us to attend classes and take notes.
